<h1>What are the typical use cases?</h1>

    to branch a new process or to find all treatments being done with the item

<div>Each item has an unique id number (top right corner). Instead of marking samples as n-Si/S1/HF/OX555/M1000 it is
    better to assign an ID number, for example ID20, or KFC20. Marking your samples (items) with the ID you'll allways
    know its prehistory.
